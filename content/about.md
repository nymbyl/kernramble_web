# Kern Ramble

Original folk-rock-country music, with an eye toward the 3:00 song

The name "Kern Ramble" could be a person.  You might imagine someone that wanders from town to town. 
It could also be a place, a gathering, a road, or a path

## Background

I have generally been writing music and recording songs since 1988.  Although I wrote some 
songs from 1982-1987 - I've lost all those recordings and forgotten them

## This site

I've tried to <a href="/catalog">catalog</a> all the songs I've written here over the years - with recordings (when available)
whether solo, or in collaboration with others.  The recording quality varies

## The Recordings

I've cataloged all the songs I do have recorded here on this site, regardless of the recording quality. 
Some of them were recording on old Tascam 4-tracks, but I've long since lost the original tapes.  So
they are degraded mixes, but all I have

## The Albums

I tend to write songs in groups or "albums" (as opposed to individual songs).  Sometimes I re-record
these several times, thinking of them as compositions.  I detail the history of these in the 
<a class="underline" href="/albums/">albums section</a>.  I also have an idea I've expanded on
in several albums I call a <a href="/narrative/">"narrative song-cycle"</a>.  The basic idea being
the album has an underlying story
