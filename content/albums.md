These days I write songs in conceptual units e.g. "album", "record".  That started as 
soon as I started writing songs - but has developed over the years.  The level of
conceptual integrity can vary, and many times I've just failed and sputtered along
the way
 
# (1983-85) Early attempt

1983 - Bored Outta' My Mind

* Bored Outta' My Mind
* My First Cigarette

I only have the sketches of the album cover, I lost the music and can't rememeber any of
the songs.  I figure that is because they were not that good

# First 'album'

## 1985

### Serenade

* Jennifer
* Serenade
* Cetacean Song (later become 'Jigsaw Puzzle')

I've lost all recordings of this - I think there were 20+ songs.  I recorded it
using a walkman, and a jambox with one microphone

# (1987-92) Figuring out the 'craft' (so to speak)

## 1987

### Circus

* Regullus
* Satan's Desk
* On Stage
* The Fictional Room
* Six Foot Five

oddball set of songs

* Scissors, Paper, Stone
* Sleepy Cyclops
* The Foundary

[Perpetual Sophmore] outtake

I believe at this point I've sort of developed my own
inner cosmology.  It may not have been communicated well though

## 1989-90

* Wilcox, Arizona
* Hand-feed Blues
